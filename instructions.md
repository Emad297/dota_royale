I want to make a custom map in dota2 like the clash royale game. I already did add all of the necessary folders to the workspace so you can work on them. What I will do on the other side is do the adjustments in the editor and map based on what you tell me to. shall we begin? You do all the coding development and I will do what you tell me to do in the UI. 

IMPORTANT:
You have to use https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools website for everything. Everything you want to implement must be understood from the documentations.

Let's always go very small and not overcomplicate features all at once and we go baby steps.

I already made a new addon called dota_royale
and created a map inside it called main_arena.vmap with 32x32 tile size using tile editor

i made the game arena and we will first focus on 1v1, so we have two players that connect to this server and can play against each other
