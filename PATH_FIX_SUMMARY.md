# Path Issue - FIXED ✅

## What Was Wrong

The error `Failed to split path` occurred because your directory structure didn't match what Dota 2 Workshop Tools expects. You had:

```
❌ OLD STRUCTURE (BROKEN):
dota_royale/
├── maps/          # ❌ Wrong location
├── materials/     # ❌ Wrong location  
├── particles/     # ❌ Wrong location
└── game/
```

Dota 2 requires a clear separation between **content** (source files) and **game** (compiled/script files).

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Reorganized Directory Structure

```
✅ NEW STRUCTURE (CORRECT):
dota_royale/
├── content/
│   └── dota_addons/
│       └── dota_royale/
│           ├── maps/          # ✅ Source map files (.vmap)
│           ├── materials/     # ✅ Source textures
│           └── particles/     # ✅ Particle sources
└── game/
    ├── panorama/              # ✅ UI files
    ├── resource/              # ✅ Config files
    └── scripts/               # ✅ Lua scripts
```

### 2. ✅ Recreated Directory Junctions

**Old junctions (pointed to wrong locations):**
- ❌ Removed

**New junctions (point to correct locations):**
- ✅ `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\content\dota_addons\dota_royale`
  → `C:\Users\Emado\Desktop\Projects\dota_royale\content\dota_addons\dota_royale`

- ✅ `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_addons\dota_royale`
  → `C:\Users\Emado\Desktop\Projects\dota_royale\game`

### 3. ✅ Updated Spawn Zones

Spawn zones in `addon_game_mode.lua` now use your actual map coordinates:
- **Radiant (bottom)**: X: -2500 to 2958, Y: -3392 to -1500
- **Dire (top)**: X: -3058 to 2958, Y: 1500 to 3392

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Open Your Map in Hammer
Since the map file moved, you need to open it from the new location:

1. Launch Dota 2 Workshop Tools
2. Go to **File → Open**
3. Navigate to: `content/dota_addons/dota_royale/maps/main_arena.vmap`
4. The map should open without errors now! ✅

### Step 2: Test Compile
Try compiling your map:
1. With the map open in Hammer, click **File → Compile Map** (or press F9)
2. Check that compilation completes without path errors
3. The error should be gone! ✅

### Step 3: Test the Game
1. Launch your addon from Workshop Tools
2. You should see:
   - ✅ The skill bar at the bottom with 4 hero cards
   - ✅ Ability to drag heroes onto the map
   - ✅ Heroes spawn in valid zones
   - ✅ Heroes auto-attack move toward enemy base

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes (Optional)

If you want to track these changes in git:

```powershell
git add .
git rm maps/ materials/ particles/ -r  # Remove old locations
git commit -m "Reorganized project structure for Dota 2 Workshop Tools compatibility"
```

## Why Junctions Instead of Symbolic Links?

Symbolic links require administrator privileges on Windows. Directory junctions work the same way but don't require admin rights, making development easier.

## Troubleshooting

**If you still get path errors:**
1. Verify junctions exist:
   ```powershell
   dir "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\content\dota_addons\" | Select-Object Name, LinkType
   dir "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_addons\" | Select-Object Name, LinkType
   ```
   Both should show `LinkType: Junction`

2. Restart Workshop Tools completely

3. If needed, recreate junctions by running:
   ```powershell
   # From your project directory
   cmd /c mklink /J "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\content\dota_addons\dota_royale" "C:\Users\Emado\Desktop\Projects\dota_royale\content\dota_addons\dota_royale"
   cmd /c mklink /J "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota_addons\dota_royale" "C:\Users\Emado\Desktop\Projects\dota_royale\game"
   ```

## Next Steps

Now that the path issue is fixed, you can:
1. ✅ Continue working on your map in Hammer
2. ✅ Test the drag-and-drop hero spawning system
3. ✅ Add more features to your Clash Royale-style game!

Your workspace is now properly set up for Dota 2 custom game development! 🎮
